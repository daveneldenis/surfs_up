The mean precipiation for June is 0.136 compared to Dec at 0.217 and the mean temp for June is 75 and for Dec is 71. The precipitation and temperature for both June and December are perfect for the business model focused on surfing and ice cream. Its definitely warmer in June but more rain is expected in December. The climate in June is more ideal but one can conclude that Oahu has a climate that would generate the perfect weather based on mid year and end of year climate data points.

Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
The investors would need information on potential customers now that we understand the weather patterns. How many visitors are there to Oahu in summer compare to winter. Running a statistical analysis on visitors to Oahu would provide more insight. I would also need to generate how many vistors are into surfing from novice to high level expert. Lastly, ice cream as a desert for vistors that surf would provide further insight into potential sales for the new business.
